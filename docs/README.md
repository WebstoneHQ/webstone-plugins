# Webstone Documentation

For a brief introduction and how to get started, please refer to the [README.md](../README.md).

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

Webstone provides a `pnpm webstone` (or `pnpm ws` for short) CLI, making interacting with your full-stack application simpler and more streamlined.

A list of available commands is available in [`../packages/cli/docs`](../packages/cli/docs).
