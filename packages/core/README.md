# Webstone Core

TODO: This is the only Webstone dev dependency required by the `create-webstone-app/template/package.json` file.
TODO: Use `./package.json` `devDependencies` to provide additioal functionality to Webstone apps, e.g. the `@webstone/cli` package located in this repo at `packages/cli`.

TODO: How do we deal with extensibility so that anyone can write Webstone modules and provide them to Webstone projects?
