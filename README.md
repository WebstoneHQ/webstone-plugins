# Webstone

Start your next web application with Webstone and configure it as you go.

```
pnpm init webstone-app my-project
```

> **Note**: Webstone requires the use of `pnpm` (https://pnpm.io). To install it, please run: `npm i -g pnpm`

What you get with the above command is a full-stack application project - everything you need when you develop a modern web application. More specifically, the project contains:

- Frontend
  - ‚úÖ [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
  - ‚úÖ [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)
  - ‚è≥Ô∏è [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)
  - ‚è≥Ô∏è [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)
- Backend
  - ‚è≥Ô∏è [SvelteKit endpoints](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#routing-endpoints)
  - ‚è≥Ô∏è Your database of choice
- Deployment
  - ‚è≥Ô∏è Your platform of choice

## The backstory of Webstone

### 2017

I ([mikenikles on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mikenikles)) started to write about developer experience & productivity [as far back as 2017](https://www.mikenikles.com/blog/a-mostly-automated-release-process) and continued to do so on a regular basis.

### 2019

In January 2020, I open sourced a [`monorepo-template`](https://github.com/mikenikles/monorepo-template) repo which I had used as a template for a few projects.

### 2020

In summer of 2020, I released the [Cloud Native Web Development](https://www.mikenikles.com/cloud-native-web-development) book and corresponding source code to help web developers go from zero to production. It contains everything from `git init` to monitoring a web application in a production environment.

Ever since, I have received feedback from readers who thanked me for putting the source code together and how it saved them weeks of setting up their web app project. It's been encouraging to hear from individuals and from software agencies who are able to cut their time to market significantly.

### 2021

Webstone is the next logical step!

With Webstone, I am working on a complete project starter kit you can use to develop your next full-stack application based on modern technologies. It is based on what I see as the next big thing:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) & [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)
- Your database of choice
- Deployed to any platform ([Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), [Begin](https://begin.com), AWS, GCP, etc.).
